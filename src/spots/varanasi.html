          A major pilgrimage center for Hindus, the holy city of Varanasi has
          long been associated with the mighty Ganges River, one of the faith's
          most important religious symbols. Dating back to the 8th century BC,
          Varanasi is one of the oldest still inhabited cities in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          It offers many reasons to visit, not least of them the chance to
          explore the Old Quarter adjacent to the Ganges where you'll find the
          Kashi Vishwanath Temple, built in 1780 (the New Vishwanath Temple with
          its seven separate temples is also of interest).
        </p>
        <p>
          Bathing in the Ganges is of great importance to Hindus, and numerous
          locations known as "ghats" feature stairways leading to the water
          where the faithful bathe before prayers.
        </p>
        <p>
          All told, Varanasi boasts more than 100 ghats, the largest being
          Dasashvamedh Ghat and Assi Ghat (the latter, at the confluence of the
          Ganges and Asi rivers, is considered particularly holy). Also worth
          seeing is Banaras Hindu University, established in 1917 and noted for
          its massive library with more than a million books, and the superb
          Bharat Kala Bhavan museum featuring fine collections of miniature
          paintings, sculptures, palm-leaf manuscripts, and local history
          exhibits.
