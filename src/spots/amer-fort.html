          Amer Fort (often also spelt "Amber") was built as a fortified palace
          in 1592 by Maharaja Man Singh I and has long served as the capital of
          Jaipur. Carved high up into the hillside, the fort is accessible on
          foot via a steep climb or by shuttle rides from the town below (better
          still, let an elephant do the work). Highlights include Jaleb Chowk,
          the first courtyard, with its many decorated elephants, and the Shila
          Devi Temple, dedicated to the goddess of war. Also of note is the
          adjoining Hall of Public Audience (Diwan-i-Am) with its finely
          decorated walls and terraces frequented by monkeys.
        </p>

          Other highlights include Sukh Niwas (the Hall of Pleasure) with its
          many flowerbeds and a channel once used to carry cooling water, and
          the Temple of Victory (Jai Mandir), notable for its many decorative
          panels, colorful ceilings, and excellent views over the palace and the
          lake below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just above Amer Fort is Jaigarh Fort, built in 1726 by Jai Singh and
          featuring tall lookout towers, formidable walls, and the world's
          largest wheeled cannon. Be sure to also spend time wandering the
          walled Old City of Jaipur with its three fully restored gates and
          splendid bazaars, as well as the delightful City Palace, a massive
          complex of courtyards, gardens, and buildings.
