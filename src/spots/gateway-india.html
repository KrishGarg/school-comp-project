          Standing an impressive 26 meters tall and overlooking the Arabian Sea,
          the iconic Gateway of India is a must-see when in Mumbai. Built to
          commemorate the arrival of King George V and his wife Queen Mary in
          1911, this stunning piece of architecture was opened with much pomp
          and ceremony in 1924 and was, for a while, the tallest structure in
          the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          Constructed entirely of yellow basalt and concrete and notable for its
          Indo-Saracenic design, the Gateway of India was also the scene of a
          rather less jubilant procession of British soldiers in 1948 when India
          gained its independence. These days, the huge archway provides a
          stunning backdrop that is as popular among locals as it is tourists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hot Tip: After visiting the Gateway of India, pop over to the adjacent
          Taj Mahal Palace and Tower for a delectable High Tea, a fun thing to
          do in Mumbai since this lovely luxury hotel opened in 1903.
