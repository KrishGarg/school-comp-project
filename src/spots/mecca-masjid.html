          Construction of Hyderabad's Mecca Masjid, one of the world's largest
          mosquesâ€“and one of the oldest in Indiaâ€“began in 1614 during Mohammed
          Quli Qutub Shah's reign and took almost 80 years to complete. Large
          enough to accommodate 10,000 worshipers, this beautiful mosque's 15
          enormous arches and pillars were each wrought from single slabs of
          black granite dragged to the site by huge cattle trains reputedly
          consisting of up to 1,400 bulls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking its name from the bricks above the central gate that were
          brought here from Mecca, this impressive complex features highlights
          such as its main gateway, huge plaza, a large manmade pond, and a room
          that houses the hair of Prophet Mohammed. Other notable features
          include inscriptions from the Quran above many of the arches and
          doors, the exquisite roof of the main hall, the cornices around the
          entire mosque structure, and the floral motifs and friezes over the
          arches.
