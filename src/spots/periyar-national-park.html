          One of South India's most popular tourist attractions, Periyar
          National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary is centered around a lake built
          by British engineers in 1895 for irrigation and to provide water to
          the city of Madurai. Established in 1934, this beautiful park is home
          to numerous species of mammals, including a large free-roaming Indian
          elephant population, wild boar, otters, the lion-tailed macaque, and
          more than 20 Bengal tigers. Bird watching is a popular activity with
          frequent sightings of species such as darters, storks, kingfishers,
          hornbills, and racket-tailed drongos, along with many interesting
          varieties of butterflies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best ways to enjoy the park's splendid mountain scenery are to
          take a lake cruise or guided jungle walk, the latter allowing visitors
          a chance to come face to face with elephant herds and observe other
          wildlife from watchtowers and viewing platforms. Hot Tip: Be sure to
          stop at one of the many nearby spice, tea, or coffee plantations for a
          tour.
