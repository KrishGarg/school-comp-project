          Founded in 1577 by Ram Das, Amritsar is an important hub of Sikh
          history and culture. The main attraction here is Harmandir Sahib,
          opened in 1604 and still often referred to as the Golden Temple for
          its beautiful gold decoration. The holiest of India's many Sikh
          shrines (it also attracts many Hindus and people of other faiths), the
          temple was built in a blend of Hindu and Islamic styles, its lower
          marble section featuring such flourishes as ornate inlaid floral and
          animal motifs, while the large golden dome represents a lotus flower,
          a symbol of purity to Sikhs.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to its splendid design, visitors are equally impressed
          with the temple's spiritual atmosphere, an effect enhanced by the
          prayers continuously chanted from the Sikh holy book and broadcast
          throughout the complex. Part of the overall experienceâ€“and visitors
          are welcome to participateâ€“is the chance to enjoy one of the 50,000
          free meals the attraction serves up to visitors each and every day.
