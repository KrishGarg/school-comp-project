          Built by Shah Jahan in 1648 as the seat of Mughal powerâ€“a role it
          maintained until 1857â€“the magnificent crescent-shaped Red Fort in New
          Delhi, named after the stunning red sandstone used in its
          construction, covers a vast area of more than two square kilometers,
          all of it surrounded by a large moat. Highlights include its two
          largest gates: the impressive Lahore Gate (the fort's main entrance)
          and the elaborately decorated Delhi Gate, once used by the emperor for
          ceremonial processions.

          A fun part of a visit is exploring Chatta Chowk, a 17th-century
          covered bazaar selling everything from jewelry to silk garments, as
          well as souvenirs and food items. While you can explore the fort
          yourself, guided tours are offered and provide a fascinating insight
          into the life and times of the Shah, including a peek into the
          stunning white marble Hall of Public Audiences (Diwan-i-Am) where he
          received his subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hot Tip: Try to stick around for the sound and light show held each
          evening featuring important events in the fort's history.
