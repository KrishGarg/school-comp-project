          Dominating the old city of Jodhpur, the massive Mehrangarh Fort, one
          of the largest fortifications in India, was built in the 15th century
          to safeguard the people of the famous "Blue City," as Jodhpur is still
          known - a name derived from its indigo colored houses, painted blue to
          deflect the heat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Built on top of a towering outcrop, Mehrangarh is an amazing feat of
          construction, its massive walls all but impenetrable. Access is via
          one of seven splendid gates, including Jaya Pol and Fateh Pol (the
          latter still bears scars from cannon attacks).
        </p>
        <p>
          Highlights of a visit include exploring the fort's fascinating network
          of courtyards and palaces, as well as a museum housing a splendid
          collection of artifacts related to the Maharajas. Be sure to spend
          time in the historic center of Jodhpur itself, famous for its eight
          city gates, a lovely old clock tower, and numerous bazaars selling
          everything from vegetables to sweets, spices, and handicrafts.
