          The famous monumental Ellora Caves were built between the 5th and 10th
          centuries by Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu monks, and make for an
          excellent excursion from Mumbai, some 300 kilometers to the west.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, this remarkable collection of 34
          carved monasteries, chapels, and templesâ€“12 of them Buddhist, 17
          Hindu, and five belonging to the Jain faithâ€“were built in close
          proximity to each other, a reflection of the religious tolerance that
          existed during this period of Indian history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of the Buddhist monastery caves, highlights include a number of
          shrines featuring carvings of Buddha and saints dating from the 5th to
          7th centuries, as well as the stunning Carpenter's Cave, considered
          one of the finest in India.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hindu caves are much more complex and were carved from the top
          down, so scaffolding was not necessary. Of these, the best is the
          Kailasa Temple, an enormous rock-cut temple representing Mount Kailasa
          and requiring the removal of 200,000 tons of rock.
