          So named for the yellow sandstone used in most of its buildings, the
          Golden City of Jaisalmer is an oasis of splendid old architecture that
          rises from the sand dunes of the Thar Desert. Once a strategic
          outpost, today the city is filled with splendid old mansions,
          magnificent gateways, and the massive Jaisalmer Fortâ€“also known as the
          Golden Fortâ€“a daunting 12th-century structure that rises high above
          the town.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to its palaces, temples, and fine old homes, the fortress
          boasts 99 bastions along with massive gates leading to its main
          courtyard where you'll find the seven-story-tall Maharaja's Palace.
          Started in the early 1500s and added to by successive rulers right up
          until the 19th century, the palace offers sections open to the public
          including areas beautifully decorated with tiles from Italy and China,
          and intricately carved stone doors, as well as a number of Jain
          temples dating from the 12th to 16th centuries, each decorated with
          fine marble and sandstone images, palm-leaf manuscripts, and brightly
          painted ceilings.

          Be sure to also check out the well-preserved 1,000-year-old library,
          Gyan Bhandar, with its many 16th-century manuscripts and antiquities.
