          Long known within India as the "go-to" destination for those seeking a
          great beach holiday, Goa's beautiful western coastline, overlooking
          the Arabian Sea, has only recently been discovered by tourists from
          overseas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Goa's more than 60 miles of coastline is home to some of the world's
          loveliest beaches, each with their own particular appeal. For those
          looking for peace and quiet, isolated Agonda Beach is a good choice,
          while Calangute Beach is by far the most commercial and crowded.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those in search of posh resorts, yoga getaways, and spa vacations,
          the beaches of Mandrem, Morjim, and Ashwem are fashionable among
          wealthy Indians and Westerners alike. Palolem is another popular
          option in a beautiful setting.
        </p>
        <p>
          While in Goa, be sure to visit the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary.
          This superb attraction is home to thick forests and plenty of fauna,
          including deer, monkeys, elephants, leopards, tigers, and black
          panthersâ€“as well as India's famous king cobrasâ€“and some 200 species of
          birds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also worth a visit is Divar Island, accessed by ferry from Old Goa.
          Highlights include Piedade, a typical Goan village and home to the
          Church of Our Lady of Compassion with its interesting stucco work,
          Baroque plaster decorations, and altars, as well as stunning views of
          the surrounding countryside.
