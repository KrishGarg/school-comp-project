          The sprawling city of Mysore is a delight to explore thanks to its
          eclectic mix of fine old colonial architecture; regal Indian palaces;
          and lush, well-manicured gardens. While those inclined towards
          shopping will enjoy spending time in the city's famous silk and
          sandalwood bazaars, the main attraction is magnificent Mysore Palace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Completely rebuilt in 1897 after a devastating fire, this beautiful
          three-storied palace features highlights such as its elegant square
          towers and domes; the many ornate ceilings and pillars in Durbar Hall;
          and the splendid Marriage Pavilion, with its glazed floor tiles,
          stunning stained glass, artworks, and displays of jewelry (it's also
          where, on special occasions, the exquisite Golden Throne is
          exhibited).
        </p>
        <p>
          For a real treat, be sure to catch one of the splendid light displays
          held each Sunday and during holidays, when the palace is illuminated
          by more than 90,000 lights. A fun way to explore the palace's massive
          grounds and gardens is as part of a cycle tour, available free once
          inside.
