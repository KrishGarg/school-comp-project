          Built as a military structure in 1565 by Emperor Akbar with later
          additions by Shah Jahan, the stunning Agra Fort (also known as Agra's
          Red Fort) is an interesting mix of both Hindu and Muslim influences.
          Located a little more than two kilometers from the Taj Mahal, the fort
          is entered through Amar Singh Gate with its low outer wall and dogleg
          design built to confuse attackers. Once inside, you'll see two large
          interlinked sandstone buildings, Akbari Mahal and Jahangiri Mahal, the
          largest private residence in the complex.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other highlights include the Khas Mahal (Private Palace), with its
          splendid copper roof, and the Anguri Bagh (Grape Garden), a
          jigsaw-patterned Mughal garden with numerous wonderful fountains and
          water channels as well as screens that once offered a private area for
          the emperor and his entourage. Also of note is the octagonal Musamman
          Burj tower, which later served as Shah Jahan's prison until his death.
