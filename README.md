## Description

It's a site showing the top 15 tourist spots recommended by the internet. It is also my project for the 1st board examination, class 10th E, 2021-22.

## Technologies used

- HTML.
- TailwindCSS for faster css development.
- Vite for better development experience.

And I know I could have used React but it didn't feel right to use React in a practical in which only HTML is in syllabus.

Mid-Development Review: I should have just used React. I am regretting it now.

End-Development Review: I regret everything now. Vite wasn't meant for this. And it would have been way better to make this with React because there is a lot of repeated code.
